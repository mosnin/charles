/**
 * Snapshot the exact wording of the integrations-page trust sentence.
 *
 * The sentence is the answer to a realtor's actual fear ("am I handing
 * Chippi the keys to my inbox?"). Drive-by copy edits that soften it back
 * into corporate fluff would make this fix moot — so we read the page's
 * source and assert the verbatim string is present. Any change to that
 * sentence has to flip this test on purpose.
