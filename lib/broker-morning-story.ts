/**
 * Pure composition for the /broker home story.
 *
 * Mirrors lib/morning-story.ts but for the broker's question — "who needs my
 * attention on the team today?" Names a realtor by first name when the
 * loudest fact has a person on it. Doorway opens straight to that realtor
 * (or to the leads queue when the loudest fact is unassigned leads).
 *
 * Lives outside the route so the brand voice is snapshot-testable without
 * spinning up Supabase.
